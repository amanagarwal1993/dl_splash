        <h3>Why does this site exist?</h3>

        <p>In December 1938, Germany, when Hitler's Nazi empire was at its peak before the war, a German chemist named
            Otto
            Hahn did an experiment with his assistant Fritz Strassman. They struck a Uranium atom with a neutron, and
            found
            that the reaction produced Barium. "Oh that's neat," they thought.</p>

        <p>They wrote a paper describing the results and shared it with one of their friends, a Jewish physicist named
            Lise
            Meitner (a woman who had recently been persecuted by the Nazis and was on the run). She read the paper and
            discussed it with her nephew.</p>

        <p>As they read Hahn's paper, something stood out to them. They did some calculations... and realized that Hahn
            had
            performed the most terrifyingly powerful chemical reaction known to humanity at the time without even
            realizing
            it.</p>

        <p><em>He had split the atom</em> — discovering nuclear fission and launching the age of atomic weapons.</p>

        <p>They immediately shared this with other scientists, kicking off a chain of events that ultimately led to
            Albert
            Einstein sending a warning to President Roosevelt of the USA, who later announced the Manhattan Project.</p>

        <p>You should definitely read more about this exciting story, but one thing I want you to notice right now is
            the
            extent to which science and technology relies on good discussions around new research. The more people read
            research papers and share ideas, the faster the world will progress.</p>

        <p>Today, scientific discourse is broken. Technical research papers can be very hard to read, full of
            unnecessary jargon and overly fancy lingo. This painful sentiment is shared by surprisingly many people in
            the scientific community - from undergraduate students to <a href="/roald-letter">Nobel laureate
                researchers</a>. Scholars around the world are further separated by language barriers.</p>

        <p>Moreover, reading a research paper is often a very lonely undertaking - you read it all by yourself and
            <em>then maybe</em> discuss it with other people. When you get stuck, it can take a lot of time and energy
            before things make sense.
        </p>

        <p>All this discourages millions of people from even <em>attempting</em> to engage with high-quality research.
            However, we believe it can also be a fun, social, highly collaborative exercise - like a group of friends
            looking at a treasure map, trying to make sense of it together.</p>

        <p>DenseLayers' vision is to create the best space in the world for high-quality discussions and
            knowledge-sharing around breakthrough research — and make it such that everyone feels welcome, regardless of
            their level of expertise in a particular domain or which language they speak.</p>

        <p>We invite you to join us, and hope to build a kind, helpful and courageous community together.</p>
